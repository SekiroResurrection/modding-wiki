# Welcome to the Sekiro Modding wiki!

#### This repository is designed to give users a clear and concise way to find tools, resources, guides and general information about modding Sekiro. 

We chose to create a dedicated wiki due to a lack of specific answers and resources targeting Sekiro: Despite being evidently similar, Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 have significant - and often undocumented - changes. This repository gives us the opportunity to correct that and better assist people in the community that are interested in making their own modifications.

# Where to start?
